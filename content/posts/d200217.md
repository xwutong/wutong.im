Even with something I really do well, I like to step back to relish my better of others. In that light, I enjoyed my outstandingness, but at the same time I know well enough that such things as winning over other "common folks" is not worth preening myself on. So my mind was trapped in such a turmoil of conflicts, both strong and impelling. Perhaps that's why no matter what the results are, wether I succeed or not, I always find my self brooding over something. I don't think a person should be cocky and being praised leads to complacency. I hate praise but I can't help feeling proud if I do well. 

Maybe that's why I can't focus, indistracted. The consequences are not worth the exertion.
