*I read them to learn what to think, not how to think for myself.*

There were wonderful **suppositionS** embedded in this method of reading: that ~~the~~ books ~~were~~ are not tricks, and **that** I ~~am~~ was not feeble.

I could tolerate any form of cruelty better than ~~praise~~ kindness. Praise was a poison to me **;** I choked on it. I wanted the professor to shout at me, wanted it so badly ~~that~~ I felt dizzy from the deprivation.

**Scholar or whore, both couldn't be true. One was a lie.**
