## Diary

We all have a history, some shibboleth holding us back. It's intransigent like Gene or Shawn, only not quite human.

I stayed up into the night.

## Dialogue

I: That was the first time I heard statistical softwares, something like SPSS. It is so vague that as if from a previous life.  
LF: Almost 20 years.
I: Dear Lord.

That was how long I have been stuck, lost in life.
